There are two type of imports you can choose from.

**Keep Existing Saved Variables**

* Is the safest way to import.  This option keeps all your current files and only imports new ones. 
If a file that is being imported matches one on the current system, the one on the current system will be left untouched,
and you will have to manually import these files.

**Overwrite Saved Variables**

* Is a good when you have a empty documents library or you at looking to refresh your current library.  
This method deletes all files, posted and version on the current system. After the method has completed you will
get a list of all the conflicts that have occurred make note of them.
